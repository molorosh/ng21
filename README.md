# ng21
A small webapp to learn angular v21 and to see how angular's features work with development concepts like Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design.

## basic setup
### installation
To create an angular web-app with a specific version of angular installed locally I did the following:

- inside the ng21 folder I opened a terminal and typed:
```shell
npx -p @angular/cli@9.1 ng new ng-twenty-one
```
- confirmed the installation with 'y'
- then I answered the standard installation questions about CSS and Server-Side rendering
- and then the project was created
### git-hub self-hosting 
- in the ng-twenty-one folder run the command:
```shell
ng build
```
this will create a build in ng21\ng-twenty-one\dist\ng-twenty-one\browser
